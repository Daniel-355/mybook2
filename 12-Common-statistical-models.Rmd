# Common statistical models

This chapter reviews widely used statistical modeling approaches, including survival analysis for time-to-event data, logistic and Poisson regression for binary and count outcomes, quantile regression for distributional effects, and principal components analysis for dimensionality reduction; it also discusses practical modeling considerations such as covariate adjustment strategies, variable selection methods, and handling heteroscedastic or fan-shaped relationships in regression to ensure valid inference and robust model performance.

## Survival analysis

#### Survival analysis  

This [section](https://rpubs.com/Daniel_He/1313702) introduces the core survival analysis framework—survival, hazard, and cumulative hazard functions under random censoring—and shows how to estimate and compare survival curves nonparametrically using the Kaplan–Meier estimator and the log-rank test. It then presents parametric models (exponential/Weibull) and the Cox proportional hazards model, covering likelihood/partial-likelihood estimation, interpretation of coefficients (time ratios or hazard ratios), and key diagnostics such as the proportional hazards assumption and influential observations.

#### Joint model with longitudinal and survival data

This [report](https://rpubs.com/Daniel_He/1315576) demonstrates how to fit and evaluate joint models linking longitudinal biomarker trajectories (log serum bilirubin via LME) with time-to-event outcomes (Cox/competing risks), including PH diagnostics, dynamic survival prediction (AUC/ROC, survfitJM), and interpretation of biomarker–risk association parameters using the JM package.

## Save And Finalize Your trained Model
This [report](https://rpubs.com/Daniel_He/1289468) demonstrates how to train, save, reload, and deploy both a linear regression model and a random forest model in R using saveRDS() and readRDS(), enabling model persistence and reproducible prediction workflows.
