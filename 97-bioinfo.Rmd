This section shows a compact R workflow for sequence analysis: perform multiple sequence alignment, run RNA-seq differential expression with DESeq2 (normalization, testing, volcano/PCA plots), build and optimize phylogenetic trees from aligned sequences (and compare trees with Robinson–Foulds distance plus bootstrap support), and finish with simple pathway/enrichment checks using Fisher’s exact test or rank-based tests like Wilcoxon.
